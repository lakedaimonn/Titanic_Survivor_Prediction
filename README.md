# Titanic_Survivor_Prediction
Two solutions for a famous Machine Learning example problem
data files are also uploaded ('titanic_wiki.xlsx' for example 1, and 'train.csv', 'test.csv' and 'text_result.csv' for example 2)
The two examples use different approaches:
e.g. example 1 uses OneHotEncoder method while example 2 uses LabelEncoder
and, example 2 also checks the success rate
